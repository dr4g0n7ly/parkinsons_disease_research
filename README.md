### Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It is characterized by a decline in the production of dopamine, a chemical messenger in the brain that helps regulate movement and coordination. Symptoms typically develop gradually and include tremors, stiffness, slow movement (bradykinesia), and impaired balance. People with Parkinson's may also experience non-motor symptoms such as depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive changes. The exact cause of Parkinson's is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to contribute to its development. While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
